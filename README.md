# 🧠🎨 Text-to-Image Generation Portfolio Project

This project showcases a minimal yet powerful **Text-to-Image Generation MVP** using **Stable Diffusion** and **Hugging Face's Diffusers** library — fully implemented in **Google Colab** and optimized for portfolio demonstration, learning, and experimentation.

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

To create a modular, well-documented implementation of **text-to-image generation** using powerful generative models like **Stable Diffusion**. This project highlights your ML engineering capabilities and ability to leverage state-of-the-art models efficiently, especially within the constraints of free-tier environments like Google Colab.

---

## 🧰 Core Features

- ✅ **Basic Text-to-Image Generation** using Stable Diffusion v1.5.
- 🎛️ **Image Customization Parameters**: resolution, inference steps, guidance scale, seed control.
- 📝 **Prompt Engineering Utilities**: positive/negative prompts, structured examples.
- 💾 **Image Management**: auto-saving to Google Drive, metadata logging, reproducibility.
- 📦 **Batch Generation**: generate multiple images with varied inputs.

---

## 🌟 Advanced Features (Planned)

- 🧩 Support for multiple Stable Diffusion model versions.
- 🖌️ Inpainting, Outpainting, and Image-to-Image transformation.
- ⚡ Memory-efficient inference with `float16` precision.
- 📘 Rich documentation with annotated notebooks and utility functions.
